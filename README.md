# HTTP Terminal

HTTP REPL in a browser. Talk REST on the go like a pro!

Inspired by the awesome http-console for node.js by Alexis Sellier. Whereas http-console
requires node.js, this project http-terminal will run in a browser. Now you can REPL to your
heart's content as easily as opening a browser, no matter where you are.
